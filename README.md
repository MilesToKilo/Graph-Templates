# Graph-Templates
Data visualization is a critical tool that can help identify patterns or differences in your data. Depending on your variable types, data can be visualized in so many ways. In preparation for data analysis, I've made an assortment of graphs using the sample data provided by R. I hope that these scripts can be used as templates for your own graphs, which I already do myself.
