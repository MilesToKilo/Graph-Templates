# Graph-Templates
Data visualization is a critical tool that can help identify patterns or differences in your data. Depending on your variable types, data can be visualized in so many ways. In preparation for data analysis, I've made an assortment of graphs using the sample data provided by R. I hope that these scripts can be used as templates for your own graphs, which I already do myself. The templates incorporate as many modifiers as I could so that I can tweak any specific detail. You can modify and reduce the template as needed when converting into visuals or even your own template!
